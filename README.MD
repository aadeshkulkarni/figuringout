### How to setup locally

#### Backend
- cd backend
- Add Postgres DATABASE_URL in .env (You can get a postgres connection string for free from https://aiven.io/)
- Add Prisma connection pool DATABASE_URL in wrangler.toml file (You can get the Prisma connection string for free from https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate)
- Add JWT Secret JWT_SECRET in wrangler.toml file (This can be any value)
- npm install
- npm run dev 

> wrangler.toml is the environment configuration file for the serverless backend. .env is also used by Prisma for connection pooling. So, ensure you are configuring both env files.

#### Frontend
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm run dev
