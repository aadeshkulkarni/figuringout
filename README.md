### üíª Local Setup

#### Backend

- Navigate into the backend directory 
```bash
cd backend
```
- Create a copy of .env.example and name the file `.env`
- Set up Postgres DATABASE_URL in .env file. You can get a free PostgreSQL connection string from [Aiven.io](https://aiven.io/).
- Set up Prisma connection pool DATABASE_URL in wrangler.toml file. You can get this for free from [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate).
- Set up JWT Secret JWT_SECRET in wrangler.toml file. This can be any value.
- Install dependencies using 
```bash 
npm install
```
- Run the application locally using 
```bash
npm run dev
```

> Note: wrangler.toml is the environment configuration file for a serverless backend. .env is used by Prisma for connection pooling. Ensure you configure both environment files accordingly.

#### Frontend

- Navigate into the frontend directory using 
```bash
cd frontend
```
- Install dependencies using 
```bash
npm install
```
- Run the application locally using 
```bash
npm run dev
```

> Note: `frontend/src/config.ts` contains `BACKEND_URL`. If you need your frontend to point to local backend server, uncomment `export const BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:8787"`.

#### AI based Article content generation

- set `FF_ENABLE_AI` = true in config.ts
- set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in wrangler.toml file in the backend.
- The feature is enabled only when title is atleast 10 characters long.
