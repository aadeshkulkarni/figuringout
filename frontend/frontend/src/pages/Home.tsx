				Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share insightful
				perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the world—without building a mailing
				list or a following first. The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of
				insight. It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right audience for
				whatever you have to say.

				We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or
				discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win,
				we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for
				thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging.
			</p>
			<p className="py-4 text-lg leading-8">
				Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of the world through the
				power of writing.
