          " To laugh often and much: To win the respect of intelligent people
          and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest
          critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate
          beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better
          whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social
          condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you
          lived. This is to have succeeded."
